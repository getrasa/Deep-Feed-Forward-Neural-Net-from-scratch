# Deep-Feed-Forward-Neural-Net-from-scratch
The purpose of this project is to build Deep Feed Forward Neural Network from scratch in python as well as implement and test few regularization techniques such as: 
- Dropout 
- L2 Norm 
- Batch Norm 
- Mini-batches
- Weight Decay 

After the network is built, it will be trained using images of cats and dogs in order to learn the mapping from the inputs to the output and classify them correctly.  Feed Forward Neural network is not the best choice for image classification and is significantly inferior to Convolutional Neural Network. It's merely used for the purpose of showing how varying regularization techniques affect the performance of the model.
